# Prework - Prework

Submitted by: Dallas Scott

Prework is an app that displays my name, university, desired job, and a button
which when clicked will change the background of the screen to a random color.

Time spent: 2 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Three favorite applications:
- Procreate: 
	* Unobstrusive sliders for adjusting opacity and brush size that can be
	  placed anywhere on the periphery of the canvas.
	* Previews of works on the main screen that permit easy navigation to
	  and organization of files.

- Goodnotes:
	* Ability to open PDFs as notebooks for annotation.
	* Seamless transitions between pages and different styles of line types
	  for note-taking

- Lifesum:
	* Integration of barcode scanner for easy tracking of calories.
	* Interactive water cups + separation into meal periods on main
	  dashboard screen for easy navigation.

App Idea:  Interactive origami creation/tutorial app.  It would feature a
	   digital square of paper which can be manipulated via touch and
           drag to move corners and create folds, along with interactive
	   tutorials on how to create certain objects.  The folding/manipulation
	   features would need to be sensitive enough to create significant
	   variations in output to avoid an "automated" feel to the creation
	   process and give more of a sense that the user's manipulations
	   are actually producing unique creations.

## Notes

I was initially getting errors when building and running that turned out to be
due to incorrect function naming.  I had to go back and remove all connections
of the UIButton and re-connect them to get the Prework app working.
